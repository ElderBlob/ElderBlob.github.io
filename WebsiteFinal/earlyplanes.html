    <h2>The first flight and the first planes</h2>
    <p>The first flight was conducted by brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright on Decembe 17, 1903. In 1896, the brothers became interested in flight. Working in their bicycle shop and after many years of experimentation, the Wright brothers finally were able to manage a 59 second, 852 foot flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This spurred a new age devoted to the evolution and development of new ways of achieving flight.</p>
    <p>After Orville and Wilbur's sucessful flight, airline development became much more popular. Many different types of planes were developed, such as the Silver Dart. The Silver Dart was created by a team of Americans and Canadians in 1908. It had a top speed of 40 mph and had a range of 20 miles. In 1914, the first commercial airline was created, traveling from Tampa, Florida to St. Petersburg, Florida. This airline only lasted 4 months, but was still the first commercial airline. Soon afterwards, many other airlines began to show up. In 1919, the airline KLM was created and is still in use today. Today we have many airlines, such as Southwest, American, Delta, and British Airways, but they were all inspired by earlier airplanes.</p>
