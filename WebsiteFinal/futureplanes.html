    <p>Today, planes are being redesigned and recreated to be better and more efficient when carrying passengers and cargo. As you can see from the video above, planes are being redesigned to carry more passengers. They are also being redesigned to be more fuel efficient and faster. Lastly, they are being designed to have longer range. Some planes are being redesigned, while otehrs are being created from scratch.</p>
 
    <p>While some planes are being improved upon to make them better, some aircraft are being completely reimagined and created from scratch. Different organizations, such as Boeing and NASA, have been funding projects to create new aircraft types. For example, new eco-friendly airplanes that do not consume as much jet fuel, to to supersonic passenger aircraft that can move larger amounts of passengers in less time. Also, aircraft are being designed so be bigger as to hold more passengers too save time and money. All these new designs and plans are underway, and you may see them popping up in only a few years from now.</p>
