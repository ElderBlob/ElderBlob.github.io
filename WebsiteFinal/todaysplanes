  <h5>The first flight was conducted by brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright on Decembe 17, 1903. In 1896, the brothers became interested in flight. Working in their bicycle shop and after many years of experimentation, the Wright brothers finally were able to manage a 59 second, 852 foot flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This spurred a new age devoted to the evolution and development of new ways of achieving flight.</h5>
