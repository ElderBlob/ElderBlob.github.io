    <h5>Planes have been and are still used as a valuable asset in times of warfare. Planes can run scouting missions, drop supplies to allies as well as hold the capbilities to fire missles and machine guns at enemies. During WWl, planes, such as the USA's Sopwith Camel, participated in dogfights high above the ground. During WWll, aircraft such as the B-24 Liberator and B-29 Superfortress bombed important military facilities and factories, and were greatly responsible for winning the war.
