    <h2>Planes And War</h2>
    <p>Planes have been and are still used as a valuable asset in times of warfare. Planes can run scouting missions, drop supplies to allies as well as hold the capbilities to fire missles and machine guns at enemies. During WWl, planes, such as the USA's Sopwith Camel, participated in dogfights high above the ground. During WWll, aircraft such as the B-24 Liberator and B-29 Superfortress bombed important military facilities and factories, and were greatly responsible for winning the war. Today, massive aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster traverse the world carrying massive cargo such as tanks, jeeps and helicoptors. On the other hand, sleek fighter jets, such as the F-22 Raptor, capable of going 2.35 times the speed of sound. </p>
    <h2>Plane Spotlight: The B-24 Liberator</h2>
    <p>The B-24 Liberator was one of the great planes of WWII. This American made bomber was mass produced, with over 19,000 made, to assist the US in their battles against Japan and Germany. They could carry up to 8,000 pounds of bombs. This massive aircraft flew in squadrons of hundreds of B-24s and targeted miliatry facilities and factories. Out of the hundreds, perhaps thousands of missions B-24's flew many planes went down and many pilots were killed, but these planes proved crucial in winning the war.</p>
